## Getting Started

Welcome to RADAR WORLD! Nowadays, radar technology has not just been used for aeroplanes or weather tracking, but also small things in human daily life routine such as automotive, home-monitoring, vital signs, industry and others. The use and configuration of commercial multi-purpose radars for the implementation of remote monitoring applications have been increasing in the last years. Here, we intend to share diverse function that helps in the development and processing of these systems. Be free to use and share more functions/radar systems.

The repository is organized per radar type where acquisition, processing, and reading examples can be found.  Be free to use and share more functions/radar systems. The information
